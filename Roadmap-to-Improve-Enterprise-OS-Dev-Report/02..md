Introduction 简介
============

Corporate participation in open source has reached an all-time high
and continues to grow as organizations realize the value of consuming
and contributing to open source projects
企业对开源的参与已经达到了历史最高水平并且还在继续增长，因为企业认识到使用和贡献
贡献给开源项目的价值。

(**FIGURE 1**). In addition, the nature of corporate (also called
enterprise) participation continues to evolve as organizations
increasingly discover that open sourcing proprietary technologies can
create new sources of value and more robust product ecosystems.

(**图 1**)。 此外，企业（也称为公司）参与的性质也在不断发展，因为
越来越多的组织发现，开放专有技术的资源可以创造新的价值来源和更强大的产品生态系统。

Enterprise open source development has challenges, which we discussed
in detail in "[[A Deep Dive into Open Source
Program]{.underline}](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/a-deep-dive-into-open-source-program-offices)
[[Offices: Structure, Roles, Responsibilities, and
Challenges]{.underline}](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/a-deep-dive-into-open-source-program-offices)."

企业实施开源开发有一些挑战，我们在"[[深度探讨开源项目办公室：结构、角色、责任和挑战]{.underline}](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/a-deep-dive-into-open-source-program-offices){.underline}"中详细讨论过这些挑战。

The enterprise open source journey is challenging (**FIGURE 2**), and
an organization needs to address this to build its open source
leadership. If the organization has a clear plan to implement 
internal practices and address those known challenges, the journey
becomes easier. For instance, the Linux Kernel is the largest
collaborative software project in the world, and getting involved in
the development process can be overwhelming.

企业的开源之旅是具有挑战性的（**图2**），组织需要解决这些问题以建立其开源的
领导力。如果该组织有一个明确的计划来实施内部实践并解决这些已知的挑战，那么这个旅程
会变得更容易。例如，Linux内核是世界上最大的软件协作项目，而参与到开发过程中来
可能会让人不知所措。

If you are one of the organizations that rely on the Linux Kernel for
their products and services, investing time and resources into
improving your internal development abilities, contributions process,
and syncing your development with the upstream project can pay off
immensely in the long run.

如果你们组织的产品和服务都依赖于Linux内核，那么投资时间和资源来
改善你的内部开发能力、贡献过程，并将你的开发与上游项目同步，从长远来看，会得到巨大的回报。

Fortunately, since so many organizations and individuals have been
successful at contributing to the Linux Kernel, there is a clear path
to improve your own Linux Kernel contributions and aim for a
leadership role.

幸运的是，由于许多组织和个人已经成功地为Linux内核做出了贡献，因此有一条清晰的途径来提高你对Linux内核的贡献，并争取成为一个领导角色。

Several factors drive and motivate participation in open source
projects:
有几个因素推动和促使人们参与到开源项目中：

-   Reducing the amount of work needed from product teams

-   减少产品团队所需的工作量
-
-   Minimizing the cost to maintain source code and internal software
    branches
-   最小化维护源代码和内部软件分支的成本
   
-   Improving code quality
-   提高代码质量
-   
-   Supporting faster development cycles
-   支持更快的开发周期
 
-   Producing more stable code to serve as the base for products
-   产生更稳定的代码，作为产品的基础

-   Improving the organization's reputation in critical open source
    communities、
-   提高组织在重要的开源社区的声誉
    
Organizations often upstream modifications to open source projects,
which is a fundamental aspect of the open source methodology.
Following this approach, enterprise developers submit internal changes
to the open source project for evaluation for acceptance into the main
development tree. This process achieves several technical and
nontechnical benefits for the enterprise due to such contributions
(see **FIGURE 3**).

This report covers several practices enterprises can adopt to help
grow their footprint in open source projects.
